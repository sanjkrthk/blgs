What is Hack The Box ?

Actually it is an online platform to test and advance your skills in penetration testing in the field of cyber security.

Let’s try our way in…..!



			This is Hack The Box Website.


1. At first, you have to visit Hack the Box site.

2. You have to go on https://www.hackthebox.eu/invite to join Hack The Box.

3. When you go to that page, you can see the box asking you for an invite code.

4. Now open here inspect element. Right click on the page, and open inspect element. Or use the keys, press Ctrl+Shift+I to open the Chrome Developers Tools. In Mac OSX, use the keys, press Alt+Command+I to open the Safari Developers Tools.

5. Go through the elements tab and you will find a script with source as: /js/inviteapi.min.js

	       
	       
	       
	     
		You can See the script src: /js/inviteapi.min.js



6. Now, go to https://www.hackthebox.eu/js/inviteapi.min.js . You will see a JS file like this.



	       

Here you can see the highlighted makeInviteCode

7. You can makeInviteCode looks interesting. So let’s go back to https://www.hackthebox.eu/invite and try to find its contents.


8. Goto console tab in Safari/Chrome Developer Tools, and type makeInviteCode() and press ENTER. You will get a 200 Success status and data as shown below.

	
	       
	       
	       Type makeInviteCode() and press ENTER


	       



9. When you click the small arrow alongside data, you will see the encoding type to be Base64.


	       
	       
	       
	       
		You can see the message in data.



10. Now you have to decode that message. Copy the contents of data.

	       
	       
 
For decryption you have to use offline tools or online tools. You can search online for a Base64 Decryption. You can use Google search result. I used google search’s result:- https://www.base64decode.org/

	       
11. Paste the copied data onto the text box and click DECODE. You will get something like below.

	       
	       


12. So, in order to generate an invite code, you need to make a POST request to https://www.hackthebox.eu/api/invite/generate.

13. Fire up your terminal. And make a POST request by typing:

Or copy which has given below and paste on your terminal (Windows os / Mac osx). You can see the picture.

curl -XPOST https://www.hackthebox.eu/api/invite/generate

14. You will get a success message as:


	       
	       
	       

15. As you saw, we code a code. But this is not our invite code as it says encoded.

Now you have to decode the code.


16. Lets’s try decoding this, by again using https://www.base64decode.org/.


17. Paste the code you got as the response the POST request into the box. You get your invite code. Look down in the box, code is decoded.

	       
	       
	       
	       
	       
	       
				You get your invite code

18. Now, you have to go https://www.hackthebox.eu/invite and paste the Invite Code you got in the text box asking for the same.
 
19. Congratulation You did it! Now you can Register/ sign-up on Hack the Box site, after register you become a member.
